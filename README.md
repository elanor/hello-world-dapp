## Setting up the environment

    Get the latest version using command
    `rustup update`
    When you install Rustup youâ€™ll also get the latest stable version of the Rust build tool and package manager, also known as Cargo.

    Install the extension to your IDE (for VS Code users: [Rust-analyser](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/rust) )
2. Cargo Concordium
